# Introduction
The Standard and Poor's 500 or S&P 500 is the most famous financial benchmark in the world. This stock market index tracks the performance of 500 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States. As of December 31, 2020, more than $5.4 trillion was invested in assets tied to the performance of this index. Because the index includes multiple classes of stock of some constituent companies—for example, Alphabet's Class A (GOOGL) and Class C (GOOG)—there are 505 stocks in the gauge. How is success measured and what factors affect a team’s success? What makes certain teams more successful than others? On one hand, we have trophies and league rankings which could give us a quick measure of performance, true success goes beyond just match results. Consistency, adaptability, tactical execution, and discipline are key factors that contribute to long-term dominance on the field.

# Data Overview 
3 datasets: 
- sp500_companies.csv
- sp500_stocks.csv
- sp500_index.csv

# How to use this dataset
- Create a time series regression model to predict S&P value and/or stock prices.
- Explore the most the returns, components, and volatility of the S&P 500 index.
- Identify high and low-performance stocks among the list.

# Final Thoughts 
Stock price prediction remains an extraordinarily difficult challenge. Our project shows that while we can make incremental improvements through feature engineering and careful attention to data distribution, we must maintain realistic expectations about what's possible.
